Edgely + API server is created using fastly compute@edge. It is using jsc8 driver to make API calls to GDN. It has different API endpoints like login/signup, list top movies and movies by genre, list top tv series and series by genre etc.

## Prerequisite

    SUCCESS: Created service AAAAAAAAAAA
    ```

4. Update `fastly.toml` file with service ID generated by the above command
5. Create Fastly Compute@Edge backend to connect to GDN
    ```
    $ fastly backend create --version=latest --name="gdn_url" --address="api-gdn.paas.macrometa.io" --port=443
    SUCCESS: Created backend gdn_url (service AAAAAAAAAAA version 1)
